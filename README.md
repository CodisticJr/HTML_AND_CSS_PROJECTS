# HTML_AND_CSS_PROJECTS
This file is my main Repository, others have been created in the learning process.
Once I have a better understanding I will organize better, I am working on it as 
I go, will return to tie up loose ends. I have wroked in Notepad++, and visual studios code
so far to write code, started with smallbasic with textwindow and graphic window which OIO really enjoyed
and look forward to being able to create an image on a webpage, which,
would technically be a graphic.
