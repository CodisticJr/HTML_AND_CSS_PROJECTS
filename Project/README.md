This Project Folder, I will try to keep all of the lessons of how to create a web page linking photos videos and images, 
A full working web page, this is all the templates and demos of each step, the instructions in lessons dont always specify,
I have THREE current pages I have created, in following the directions and writing the file paths and code exactly the same.
Project = templates/generic/demo  ;  Project_Spacestation = instructed page/demo(MAIN PROJECT) ; One-Page-Website = My mind/follow-along/My interpretation(Portfolio-Project??)
NOTE These three files are all different parts of a website:
 
Framework =(basic structure) what rooms/features exist in this page and where and how do they exist?);
Plumbing = (linked-external-pages) what rooms link/run to other rooms in existance?);
Electrical = (how page operates with in it self"turn light on in this room=what part of the site does user deire?"
