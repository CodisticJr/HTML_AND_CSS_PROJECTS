		<h2>Here's a quote from an idol of mine:</h2>
		<p>Robert Craig "Evel" Knievel:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/author/8151-Evel_Knievel">	"I'm not a jack of all trades; I'm a master of many. I don't feel there is anything I can't do if I want to." At 1:24 in video.</blockquote>

			<h3>Who Is the Author?</h3>
			<p> I am, Hello my name is Tim in real life, or in my newly created account on GitHub as CodisticJr. Where I have started a portfolio for my software developing career.</p>
			
			<h3>What Have I Done?</h3>
			<p>	Having worked various positions accross the construction industy, such as a labourer for a 'devolpement' company or two, a carpenter, an equipment/machine operator, a welder, and as well as a milwright along with many others.
			Now I am learning how to develop computer software and I find it to be Very Interesting!! I am learning so much and look forward to writing further complex programs than I have so far!</p>
			
			<h3>What School are you going to?</h3>
			<p> The Academy Of Learning Career Collage is the institution I am doing the Software and Web Development Program, where AOLCC has smaller and more basic programs they
			have teamed up with The Tech Academy for the computer program aspect.
			
			<h3>Where is this happening?</h3>
			<p>There is a campus located in my city, I have not yet attended the premis. I have worked through the program completely online with all the support I have required, great help might I add.</p>
			
			<h3>Why?</h3>
			<p>I was looking for a change, I wasnt going to write a "why", seemed wrong. I doubled up on the "what" was going to be my excuse.</p>
			
			<h3>When did you become interested?</h3>
			<p> I have always found computer facinating. When I was in my early teens I had attempted video editing, and downloading music. I have novicely used computers since the mid 90's.
			Last winter working outside in the elements of mothernature I was ready for a change. By chance of good luck, an opportunity was presented through AOLCC and the change command was executed.
			I find this comical and full of irony that I say "outside in the elements" because in computer programing, I am learning about working in a different style of elements.</p>
